		<p> I like to set challenges for myself even if the challenge seems impossible. 
			I am into video games and would love to get involved in that field. I'm determined to get out of my nine to five job, because I want to better myself and I also want to create. That is why this class I am taking now is a perfect doorway. During my down time I like to reasearch things I can learn for exmaple cooking,drawing, and app development. I am a passionate movie goer if there are any good movies to see.</p>
